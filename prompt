ROLE & CONTEXT

You are a senior full-stack engineer working on an existing web application called NFC Health ID System.

The system includes:

Multiple portals (Patient, Hospital, Insurance, Admin)

An Insurance Portal UI with sidebar navigation

Flask backend (API + UI routes)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript frontend

⚠️ You must edit and correct the existing implementation, not redesign or rebuild the system.

❌ PROBLEM 1: EMPTY LEFT-SIDE SPACE IN INSURANCE PORTAL
Observed Behavior

In the Insurance Portal dashboard:

There is a large empty space on the left side

Main content starts too far right

The interface does not occupy the full available width

Sidebar exists, but layout sizing is incorrect

Likely Causes

Incorrect CSS width or margin

Fixed container width (e.g., max-width)

Sidebar grid not aligned with content grid

Wrapper div not using full viewport width

Left padding reserved for unused element

✅ EXPECTED CORRECT BEHAVIOR

Insurance Portal should:

Fully utilize available horizontal screen space

Align sidebar and main content properly

Remove unnecessary left margins / gaps

The dashboard should feel full-width and balanced

No empty dead space on the left side

🔧 REQUIRED CORRECTIONS (LAYOUT)

You must:

Inspect existing Insurance Portal layout:

HTML structure

CSS grid / flexbox usage

Sidebar + content container widths

Identify why the left empty space exists

Correct the layout so that:

Sidebar starts at the left edge

Main content expands to fill remaining space

Use:

CSS Flexbox or Grid (existing system)

No new UI frameworks

Apply fix only to Insurance Portal, not globally

❌ PROBLEM 2: SETTINGS PAGE RETURNS 404
Observed Behavior

Clicking “Settings” in the Insurance Portal:

Redirects to a URL

Server returns 404 Not Found

This breaks navigation and user flow

🔍 Likely Causes

Route exists in frontend but not backend

Missing Flask route

Incorrect URL mapping

Template file missing

Typo mismatch between link and route

✅ EXPECTED CORRECT BEHAVIOR

Clicking Settings should:

Load a valid Settings page

Render a proper UI (even if basic)

No 404 errors should appear

🔧 REQUIRED CORRECTIONS (ROUTING)

You must:

Identify the exact URL triggered by Settings

Verify backend routing:

Flask UI route exists

Correct render_template() usage

If missing:

Create a minimal Settings page template

Add a proper Flask route

Ensure:

Route path matches frontend link

No conflict with API routes

Keep implementation minimal and consistent

🧱 CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT redesign the Insurance Portal

Do NOT change other portals (Patient / Hospital)

Do NOT introduce new frameworks

Use existing HTML, CSS, JS, Flask structure

Make targeted, minimal corrections only

🚫 WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO

Do NOT remove sidebar

Do NOT hardcode screen widths

Do NOT ignore routing errors

Do NOT silence 404s without fixing routes

Do NOT modify backend APIs unnecessarily

✅ EXPECTED OUTPUT

You must provide:

Explanation of why the left empty space existed

Corrected layout (HTML/CSS)

Working Settings route

Settings page template (even if basic)

Confirmation that:

Insurance dashboard uses full width

Settings page loads without 404

FINAL INSTRUCTION

Treat this as a UI layout + navigation bug-fix task, not a redesign.

Focus on:

Visual correctness

Route correctness

Minimal impact on existing system
