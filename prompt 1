my aim is to create a NFC tap card for patients to store their medial data in a DB where the DB id will be present in the card when evere the hospital taps the card this to lead to login site where the hospital should enter thier medical council registration id and password to login for the sake os signing in the hospital should provide its name, hospital email, hospital medical council regostration id for security and a patient must signin using their phone number and otp and there should be the login for the insurace company for insurace climb and hsitory and for ther possibities for insurence target balance . then there should be a seperate login forr the card provider to generate the qr and NFC tag for the new patent everything must be online only . there for in total there should be 4 logins and each card should have their own unique qr for the single patient details . so whem ever the new registration happenes the page should receive the patient details for DB and create seperate storage aer for them and the DB id should be encripted in a qr and a nfc card and qr must be priented on the card . while the hospital is tapping the card it should lead to theri login page and after loginn it should lead to the patients DB whre all the medical realted details are registerd and only hospitals can update by adding details and deleting the worngly enterd details of medical data and insurance company should have the acces to edit only the insurace data but all of them can see the data which is present in the Db and the patient is allowed to view the data but cannot edit it. now give the "architecture" of the plan
